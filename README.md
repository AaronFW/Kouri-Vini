# Kouri-Vini (built on Archagon's Tasty Imitation Keyboard)

I am currently developing a keyboard and hosting app for the Kouri-Vini Community (aka Louisianan Creole, ISO-639 lou). This keyboard is build upon Archagon's Tasty-imitation-keyboard and incorporates the improvements and modifcations made by PolishedCode.

At the current state, the keyboard works well on iPhones. However, the landscape ipad orientation is not currently correct.

NOTE: If you want to see what the keyboard is capable of, check out the project version by PolishedCode https://github.com/polishedcode/tasty-imitation-keyboard or the original by Archagon https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard


## Purpose
The keyboard was created basically to allow Kouri-Vini speakers have a language specific keyboard. I am posting it on Github for the hope that others might use this code to create keyboard support for other minority languages.

## Please note:
I have removed some features from PolishedCode's project to fit my needs and the needs of my audience. I have not yet removed the undesired code, but it has been left non-functioning. I also hope to revise the names of some fuctions to be conformed to the current project.

## License

This project is licensed by Archagon under the 3-clause ("New") BSD license. Credit also goes to PolishedCode and other Github members who have contributed. I also want to credit Apple for making a great keyboard to be reverse-engineered; so they too get a large bit of credit.
