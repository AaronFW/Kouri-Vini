# Kouri-Vini (built on Archagon's Tasty Imitation Keyboard)

I am currently developing a keyboard and hosting app for the Kouri-Vini Community (aka Louisianan Creole, ISO-639 lou). This keyboard is build upon Archagon's Tasty-imitation-keyboard and incorporates the improvements and modifcations made by PolishedCode.

At the current state, the keyboard works well on iPhones. However, the landscape ipad orientation is not currently correct.

## Purpose
The keyboard was created basically to allow Kouri-Vini speakers have a language specific keyboard. I am posting it on Github for the hope that others might use this code to create keyboard support for other minority languages.
