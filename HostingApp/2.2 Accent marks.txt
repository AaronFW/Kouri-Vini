2.2 Accent marks (diacritics)*Several diacritics or accent marks are employed and are classed into 4 categories: sound shifters, stress, homonymic, and the preterit tense marker.*The diacritics or accent markers are:*<ul><li>acute</li><li>grave</li><li>circumflex</li></ul>*2.2.1 The acute*The acute accent, or laksen égu, has 2 functions.*2.2.1.1 Stress*Similar to Spanish, Louisiana Creole has stressed syllables. As a general rule, the final syllable in words–specifically words and names ending in the letter-A–are stressed. For this reason, we do not use the acute on final vowels. On all other syllables, however, which are less frequent, we do use the acute.*(The é /e/ does not follow this stressed patten and rule.)*For instance, when a word with an acute is not followed by another word requiring stress, like pa (not; or, don't), the word retains its acute (e.g. -çála = those).*2.2.1.2 Preterit*In written Louisiana Creole, we also use the acute on the final letter in verbs (if a vowel) to visually show a completed action. This does not change the quality of the word by shifting the stress on that syllable. It is simply a visual indication for the reader that the past tense is being employed because some communities, especially those along the Mississippi River, use the infinitive in both the present and past tenses.*This becomes especially important when using the preterit in regular verbs, a class of verbs where the speaker/writer has the option of using the preterit or the present perfect. The latter requires the past tense marker té whereas the former does not.*Irregular verbs in the past tense necessitates the present perfect marker té, as the infinitive is used in the present tense of that verb class. Still here, as an added assurance for the reader, as is the case for the present perfect of regular verbs, we accentuate the final letter of the verb (only if it is a vowel) with an acute accent. Irregular verbs, therefore, only come in the present perfect form, and that form can express both the preterit and the present perfect, depending on the meaning conveyed by the speaker.* Examples<table style=width:100%><tr><th>Present</th><th rowspan="5">vs.</th><th>Preterit</th></tr>   <tr><td>Mo sorti</td><td>Mo sortí</td></tr>   <tr><td>Mo shwazi</td><td>Mo shwazí</td></tr>   <tr><td>Mo wa</td><td>Mo wá</td></tr><tr><td>Mo kwi</td><td>Mo kwí</td></tr></table>*   2.2.2 The grave*The grave, or laksen grav, is used on vowels E, I, and O as shown in section 2.1.1. It is not employed on the vowels A and U.2.2.3 The circumflex 2.2.3.1 Homonyms*The circumflex (^) is deployed where words sound the same and are spelled the same with different meanings (homonyms). This is especially important for differentiating some subject pronouns and possessive adjectives in writing.*As a rule of thumb, the circumflex will be used on the least common of the 2 words that sound–and are written–the same.For example: pyé (“foot”) vs. pyê (“shrub,” “tree,” “base”)*2.2.3.2 Possessive adjectives*The circumflex is also used to mark possessive pronouns. This distinguishes them from the subject pronouns, which would otherwise be written identically (e.g. mo “I” vs. mô “my”).*<table style=width:100%><tr><th>Creole</th><th>English</th></tr> <tr><td>mô</td><td>your (informal)</td></tr><tr><td>tô</td><td>my</td></tr><tr><td>vou</td><td>your (formal)</td></tr><tr><td>sô</td><td>his, her, its</td></tr><tr><td>nô</td><td>our</td></tr><tr><td>vou</td><td>your (plural), yall’s</td></tr><tr><td>yê</td><td>their</td></tr></table>
